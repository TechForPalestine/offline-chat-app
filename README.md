## Idea
An offline communication app for emergencies that works without the internet or cell towers using a peer-to-peer network (Bluetooth or WiFi radio) to connect devices directly, ensuring people stay in touch during blackouts.

## Objective
Develop a communication app for users to share information[^1] without centralized infrastructure[^2].

[^1]: information: MVP starts with text data.
[^2]: centralized infrastructure: internet, hardware other than smartphones, cell towers - satellite.
